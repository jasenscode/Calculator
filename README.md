# Calculator
This is a simple calculator made using vanilla JavaScript that I built in the third week of the _nology bootcamp.

The requirement was to make a working calculator to test my understanding of the concepts learnt on the course.

Although the main aim was to demonstrate JavaScript concepts, it was also an opportunity to showcase my HTML, SCSS and design skills.
